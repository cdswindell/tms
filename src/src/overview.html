<h1>Table Management System</h1>
TMS, the Table Management System, is a framework for ad hoc analysis of complex data. 
Developed in Java, its special ability is that it allows users to defined derived columns, derived rows, and derived cells, 
to perform intensive data analysis of complex data in a familiar spreadsheet environment. 
TMS provides a rich language of over 250 functions (see below), as well as allows developers to develop their own functions to 
operate on standard or custom data types (classes) from within the framework. For example, functions specific to chemical and molecular analysis
could be added to the framework to evaluate molecule data.
TMS allows Java developers to easily incorporate spreadsheet-like analytics capability into web and applet applications.
<p/>
The TMS data structures are performant, and the project uses test-driven development to provide quality and code coverage. 
A rich API is provided that allows developers to easily and quickly integrate TMS into their applications. 
Full Javadoc and source are provided.
