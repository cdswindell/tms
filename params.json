{"name":"Tms","tagline":"Table Management System","body":"tms\r\n===\r\n\r\nTable Management System\r\n\r\nThe Table Management System (TMS) is a Java implementation of a type-free table system adapted from the BBN Prophet system developed under NIH grant in the 1970’s and 1980’s. It featured spreadsheets with derived columns decades before Microsoft Excel took over the desk top market. \r\n\r\nOver my career in software development, the Prophet Tables concept has been a useful data model to both store and manipulate data. In the 1990’s, I adapted the software to support a molecular spreadsheet used in the Molecular Simulations Cerius 2 software. The implementation allowed functions to be added that took “molecules” (and columns of molecules) as input and perform numerous useful molecular calculations, such as free energy, distance between atoms, substructure search, etc.\r\n\r\nA long-time goal since I developed the TMS software originally in the mid ’90s was to port the C implementation to an object-oriented language. The Java implementation in this Git Hub repository is just such a port.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
