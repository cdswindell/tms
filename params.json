It featured spreadsheets with derived columns decades before Microsoft Excel took over the desk top market. \r\n\r\nOver my career in software development, the Prophet Tables concept has been a useful data model to both store and manipulate data. In the 1990’s, I adapted the software to support a molecular spreadsheet used in the Molecular Simulations Cerius 2 software.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
