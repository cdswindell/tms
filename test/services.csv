NUTRITION COUNSELING BASICS/FAQ

What is Nutrition Counseling?

Nervous about seeing a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN)? Don’t be! A good nutrition consultation isn't like a lecture about what you should be doing, and you won’t feel as though you’re being scolded or judged on your eating habits, either. Rather, you'll experience a caring and compassionate relationship with careful listening to understand where you are right now in terms of your lifestyle and diet, and a collaborative approach to help you achieve your goals. 

Does Insurance Cover Nutrition Counseling?

Nutrition counseling (medical nutrition therapy) is a covered benefit for many insurance plans. If you or your child has a medical diagnosis such as diabetes, overweight or obesity, failure to thrive, constipation, severe food allergy or other condition, a consultation with a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN) will likely be covered. Insurance coverage does vary and a physician referral is usually required. Contact your insurance provider directly or Megan can assist with verifying coverage. Currently, Megan is an in-network provider for Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts and Harvard Pilgrim Healthcare insurances.  For other insurance networks, you will receive a superbill (detailed reciept) which you can submit to your insurance provider for reimbursement. The superbill is not a guarantee of reimbursement.

What payment options are available for services?

Payment is due at the time of service. Payment methods accepted: cash, credit (Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover), Health Savings Account (HSA) and flexible spending accounts (FSA). For in-network insurance plans (Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts and Harvard Pilgrim Health Care), direct billing is available.  For other insurance plans, you will receive a superbill which you can submit for reimbursement. The superbill is not a guarantee of reimbursement. Telehealth services are not covered by insurance.

I'm not sure what my insurance plan covers or have questions about my deductible?

This program is designed to help a SoloPreneur (you!) get MORE of the holy trinity:
more time, more money, more energy. 
And also LESS: less stress, fewer mistakes, lower costs.  

It usually takes under three weeks to put into work, and the results reported so far present entrepreneurs finally feeling (and in fact, being) in control of their businesses.

Step 1:
First, we'll make an in-depth ASSESSMENT OF YOUR CURRENT SYSTEMS AND BUSINESS NEEDS.

When you stop and reflect on the current state of affairs of the systems' piece in your business, you find surprising insights. (Such as ""I didn't realize I don't track my travel expenses!""  or ""turns out the biggest time sucker is updating my Social Media""). More importantly, a hard look into your current systems allows us to tailor the CUSTOM solution for your unique situation.
Which brings us to...

Step 2: 
You'll receive GUIDES and TEMPLATES , customized for YOUR VERY OWN BUSINESS.  
Templates save you tons of time, energy, and money. Not re-inventing the wheel ever time very quickly translates in to more productive hours and more energy. How do templates make you money?
One - by helping to avoid the majority of costly mistakes, and two - by freeing up time and mental space to take on more clients, create new products, promote your services - in short, make more income.

At the end of this program you'll have your own:

Budget and Cash Flow:
Taking the guesswork out of ""how much money is left at the end of the month"" and having a pretty good idea when you can finally buy that electric lift massage table/soulful branding class/your own studio/you-name-it.

Pricing Calculator:
My most popular service to date. Just plug in your prices and see how many hours you'll need to work and how much money you'll end up making. Now change your pricing and check the results again - how would your new numbers impact your schedule and your bottom line?

Invoice Template:
Remove this one little decision out of your workflow to make it a bit smoother.

Quote template:
Save the pain of doing the math every time you send a quote. Surprisingly, this way quotes tend to go out quicker, making the client more likely to sign up. 

Email Freedom Manual:
This one saves mind-boggling amounts of time! And overwhelm. Not to mention it's the way to stop loosing clients in your Inbox.

Time Management Guide:
This is the portion responsible for the ""SHORTER DAYS"" part of the program title. The Guide is a step-by-step, easy-to-implement manual that will save you hours without dramatic efforts and major habit overhauls on your part. Actually let me re-phrase that. It will produce hours of productive time.

But wait, that's not all!

Step 3: 
I'll walk you through IMPLEMENTATION of the ONE SYSTEM, in need of the MOST ATTENTION
(your choice):

Sometimes manuals and templates are not enough, you need an actual human come in and put something in place for you. Preferably teaching you how to make the best use of it, once it's in place. Good news - that's exactly what I'm going to do for you. You can choose one of the following systems to put in top shape:

 - Budget and Cash Flow 

 - Pricing calculator 

 - Calendar and Project Management 

 - All Your Info Organized system



This program is for you if you can relate to at least one bullet below

 * You have more clients than you can personally serve, and it's time to stop flying by the seat of your pants. This program will help you re-gain control of your business.

 * You're a whirlwind visionary, that doesn't like to be bothered by mundane stuff, because your core work is all-consuming. I'm a big believer in realistic expectations, so I won't promise to completely eliminate the need to deal with admin and operations. But you can expect to reduce your admin involvement by more than half.

  * You are beginning your entrepreneurial journey, and you want to do it right from the start.",business

You’re doing everything you can but it feels like you’re running on fumes. 
Business is growing slower than you expected.

We’ll diagnose why this happens, and put custom systems in place. Then we'll train you and your staff to run your venture kink-free and nourish your growth. 

This program usually takes anywhere between 3 to 8 months, depending on your schedule, and how fast you want to go.

HERE ARE SOME DETAILS OF WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT:

This program consists of individual sessions and a good amount of homework on your part as well as on mine. We'll work in three phases:

Intensive Setup:
We do the assessment and put most of the essential STRUCTURE in place. It's called ""Intensive"" for a reason - we'll be spending 12 hours together over the course of 2 or 3 weeks, depending on your schedule.

Training and Troubleshooting:
You and your staff are going to learn to implement the systems you now have, fix issues that might come up along the way, and ensure the tools you have are custom-tailored to your personality and to the DNA of your company. During this 4-week long phase we'll be having two-hour weekly sessions.

Habit-Forming: 
This is when you really start feeling the difference! Training is great and all, but without creating good, sustainable habits it's... pointless. The Habit-Forming phase is designed to ensure you'll be using your new systems effectively, making your business soar. A weekly hour together over the course of 8 more weeks, will help you leave my hands fully equipped to run your company from a place of relaxed control.

We'll hold our session over Skype, Zoom, GoToMeeting, or any other program you use for videoconferencing. If you're local to Boston area, we can even meet in person!

We are going to take a close look at your company, and design custom solutions to help expand your venture while keeping you comfortably in control.


Here is how it works:
After a thorough Assessment of your business needs, we'll focus on the systems that need streamlining, and in some cases we will create new systems that fit the bigger business you're becoming.  Rather than being a roadblock, the Operations of your venture should (and would!) be the engine of your growth.
 

Here are some examples of systems you can expect to see in place after a 6-month program:

Financial System and Dashboard:
Manage all your revenue streams and expenses in one place, with ease and clarity.

Project management and Delegation System:
Soaring productivity for you and your team!

Complete Client Care System: 
Ensure your customers are best cared for every single time, without you re-inventing the wheel.

This workshop will address the importance of each of these skills and give you concrete tools for teaching them to your kids. Most importantly, you'll develop the ability to model the behaviors and practice the skills yourself. You'll learn how to deliver discipline with more calm and less chaos.

Workshops can be presented in a number of different settings (including, but not limited to: schools, corporate employee training, religious organizations and schools)",family & pets

Many of us associate organizing with stress- that there’s a lot to do and not enough time to get it all done so we push it to a later date. I’ll get to it next month; let’s wait until spring; let’s just leave it here for now, etc. Sounds familiar, doesn’t it?An unorganized home, a poorly planned layout or simply the wrong furniture can be detrimental to our health and happiness. Our mental states are intimately linked with that of our homes; headspace and house space is one and the same. When you hire a home organization company, not only are you hiring them to organize your home, you’re also hiring them to organize your life.The Little Details specializes in exactly that, in transforming spaces from every angle. Your home should be a place where you can relax and enjoy time with your family and friends, not another source of stress due to the clutter and incomplete projects surrounding you. Organizing your space is all about being able to find what you need, when you need it, in a place that makes sense to you. Every closet, cabinet and surface can be organized to work to the best of its ability with the help of our organizers.The experts at The Little Details can help you organize your life in a multitude of ways. For instance, we can create a detailed home inventory for you to submit to your insurance company as we’re organizing your files and manuals. Our memorabilia organizers can help you finally get all of your precious memories, collections and historical items stored properly, organized digitally (for safekeeping) or into a photo album. Our team can design and install the closet system of your dreams; we can turn a spare closet into a gift-wrap and craft area or even a mini-office that you keep out of sight. The possibilities are truly endless.",home

We can help you find storage and organization solutions that work for you and your unique challenges. We love when your assistants and office managers participate in our sessions so that everyone is on the same page and the plan becomes more comprehensive. We all know how key communication is in every aspect of our life; at The Little Details, we strive to create an easy path of communication for each of our clients.In addition to increasing productivity and efficiency, wouldn’t it be nice to actually enjoy your workspace? Craig Knight, Director of the Identity Realization workplace consultancy, showed this in a 2010 study with Alex Haslam involving 47 office workers in London. Those workers given the opportunity to arrange a small office with as many or few plants and pictures as they wanted were up to 32 percent more productive than others not given this control. They also identified more with their employer, a sign of increased commitment to the team effort and increased efficiency.Imagine actually enjoying going to work because you love your office, you know where everything is, and you can stay focused so you can meet all of your deadlines. It all starts with getting organized! Sounds like a nice change of pace, doesn’t it?",business

The Enlightened College Application is a process that takes high school students through self-discovery in service of crafting an application that accurately reflects who they are and what they have to offer a school. Through coaching, students become aware of their values, their inner critic, and what their unique learning, thinking and motivation style is. Using this information, students create a plan for looking at, applying to, and selecting that one school that is the best fit. These same skills carry a student through college because they have learned what makes them uniquely them and in so doing, have learned how to ask for what they need, set appropriate boundaries with others, and how to spot their own personal red flags telling them to take a step back in any one particular situation. What students often need is a relationship with someone who will be honest with them, help them to be honest with themselves, and who will hold them accountable along the way. I am committed to helping students and families walk through this process together.",college counselors

While tailored to each specific student, Academic Life Coaching for middle and high school students is generally about 10 sessions of 1:1 coaching with the student and email communication with the caretaker as needed. Academic Life Coaching for college students is an ongoing relationship that helps college students with accountability and self-awareness in service of their happiness and optimal academic success.

Perspective-taking tells the family story in context. I use a holistic and mindful approach that centers on perspective-taking on all sides. This allows for the strengthening of family relationships by focusing on the social and emotional consequences of our behavior on our children and ourselves.  I coach and facilitate groups for parents in problem-solving whatever their parenting challenge may be, from infant sleep and toddler defiance, to preschooler boundary-testing and school-age homework woes, to adolescent self-esteem and identity searching, as well as anything in-between, for both neurotypical children and those who may have one or more special needs. My approach is grounded in child development and family systems theory and is informed by the latest research in psychology, neuroscience, medicine, and nutrition.


Professional Development & Consultation for Educators

I provide developmental consultations for individual children in conjunction with staff development and support at schools.  I observe the child in its natural school setting, discuss with staff, and make recommendations. If home visits can be helpful, I observe and make recommendations at home.

Is one season less exciting than another? Do you want to grow some edibles? Do you want low maintenance? I'd love to help design a custom garden you can enjoy fully!

I conduct initial exploratory site consultations in the Boston area for $200.
If you are looking for a landscape plan or planting plan, we can enter a design process. 

Typically the process goes something like this: we meet, I have some questions I'll ask about timing, budget, and scope, and I'll gather a bunch of information about the site and you and whoever else lives there or will use the space. Then I'll spend a little time pulling together a proposal for you, which I can email in PDF form. We usually talk a little by email or phone to get the scope right and the cost comfortable, then you sign a contract and send in a retainer for the work. 

After those initial steps, the real work begins! I'll gather basemaps from you or a surveyor, and I'll conduct another site visit to gather more information based on what is missing from the base maps. I will pull some concepts together, and we will meet to go over the ideas. I make adjustments to the design based on your comments. Once we are happy with the design, I draw up a work list and plant list and any necessary drawings. 

At that point we enter the bidding phase where I can gather quotes for you to get the work done, oversee it, and deliver the completed design as discussed. Timing depends on the scope of the project.

Small projects run around $5,000 or ~30 hours of work for the design phase. Bidding and construction are sometime treated as a phase together, but I can work however is comfortable for you.

Getting to know my students is very important to me as a teacher because I feel that connecting with kids is the first step to success. It is crucial for me to have as much information as possible about a child’s academic history including work samples, assessment data, IEP/504/outside evaluation information (if applicable) and parent perspectives. As a teacher, I find it very informative and helpful to communicate with any outside tutors to be able to provide the most optimal learning experiences for a child; so I would be happy to speak with teachers to share data and/or information about our tutoring sessions. I find the best tutoring environment to be in a 1:1 setting, however, depending on circumstances a very small group 2-3 students may be appropriate.

I have my own personal materials for specialized reading instruction and am able to come up with resources in other academic areas if needed, but often find that using familiar resources to the student work best. As no one child is the same, I pride myself on being able to accommodate for each individual student and finding ways for them to be successful and look forward to meeting and working with you and your special child!",tutors

Create

Hypnotherapy is a skilled verbal communication, used during hypnosis it is a state of deep relaxation, which helps direct a client’s imagination to bring about intended  alterations in sensations, perceptions, feelings, thoughts and behavior using previous medical history, general health and lifestyle, deciding on the changes or goals that are desired. This is the first step in actualizing the reality that you are longing to live.

Neurolinguistic Programming
Intend

Neurolinguistic Programming is a method of influencing brain behavior (the ""neuro"" part of the phrase) through the use of language (the ""linguistic"" part) and other types of communication to enable a person to ""recode"" the way the brain responds to stimuli (that's the ""programming"") and manifest new and better behaviors. Neuro-Linguistic Programming often incorporates hypnosis and self-hypnosis to help achieve the change (or ""programming"") that is wanted. It is known as a
model of interpersonal communication chiefly concerned with the relationship between successful patterns of behavior and the subjective experiences (esp. patterns of thought) underlying them and a system of alternative therapy based on this which seeks to educate people in self-awareness and effective communication, and to change their patterns of mental and emotional behavior. Working with this will direct intentions and pave the way for positive lifestyle changes.

Shamanism
Heal

Shamanic Healing is one of the oldest healing practices, stretching back thousands of years and linking to indigenous cultures across the globe. Essentially an energy-based therapy, shamanism is rooted in the belief that everything has an energy and that, sometimes, work needs to be done to bring things back into balance. Typically, the use of these practices is based on the concept that health issues are connected to the loss of energy, or power, and will work to balance these issues, often seeking to
return lost energy, remove negativity and return the client to wholeness. Sometimes, the bringing back advice from the spirit realms, perhaps action points, mantras or 'homework' for the client to aid them on their healing journey. As with most energy-based therapies, there is always some responsibility for the client to be absolutely willing and ready to make the change towards a positive, healthier way of being. During a session, there may be use drums, rattles, chimes, chanting and song, as well as 'sacred smudge' (a method of burning herbs or incense to spiritually cleanse and bless the area. Sometimes, there may be other healing tools, such as feathers, as well as a combination of hands on, or off, healing, (similar to that experienced during a reiki session), all of these practices would be discussed with client before this type of session.",personal care

This allows you to better handle whatever stressors are present in your life. I practice Reiki to provide deep relaxation and stress relief, as well to help my clients with:

- Anxiety, grief and trauma
- Chronic pain and illness (migraines, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue, arthritis)
- Allergies (environmental, food and chemical sensitivities, asthma, eczema)
- Injuries and treatment side effects (concussions, broken bones, joint replacement pain, dental pain, chemotherapy)
- Women's health issues (fertility, perimenopause, hormonal imbalance, endometriosis)

A Reiki treatment is totally non-invasive.  Like a massage, you lie down for Reiki, but you remain fully clothed - the treatment consists of a series of hand placements on or just above your body that send healing energy where it's most needed. The initial appointment lasts 75 minutes so I can customize your session; any follow-ups are 60 minutes.  

Generally, between one and three Reiki treatments will increase your sense of well-being. It's then up to you whether you want to come for more regular maintenance appointments.  If at any time it becomes clear that more targeted energy clearing would be beneficial to you, I can incorporate EFT tapping, Eden Energy Medicine techniques and Emotion Code clearing into your sessions. I can also test your immune system for stressors and clear them using principles of homeopathy.

Reiki is safe for people of any age and health level. And, while you should seek any other necessary medical treatment, you may come for Reiki sessions at the same time.  Over 800 hospitals now offer Reiki in conjunction with their treatments.  In the Boston area, Newton-Wellesley Hospital, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Massachusetts General Hospital, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Children’s Hospital all offer Reiki.",personal care

YOU deserve to be happy. To find your passion. To uncover what you really want. To feel like a REAL human being, and not just a breast feeding, poop cleaning, messy bun dressed in yoga pants. 

I've been where you are. In fact, THIS is the life I always said I wanted. I wanted to live each day in my yoga pants, work the hours I choose to work, and take care of my baby. ""Life will be blissful"" I remember thinking.

Yeah - right.

Two weeks into mom-hood I drank probably a total of one bottle of water, spent no more than 3 minutes in the shower, was still wearing only maternity undies, and felt a very sincere, yet scary, thought of ""what the hell am I doing?! and ""WHO THE HELL AM I?!""

See, I quit my full time job on maternity leave to make my part time passion a full time gig...and then I felt like I fell flat on my face. I had some clients, I had the motivation, but I felt like crap. I didn't know how to take care of myself anymore - now that there were two of me - and I wanted to feel like me again...but I no longer knew what ""me"" felt like anymore.

So, I started to figure it out by addressing things as they came on. If I felt dehydrated, I ampd up the water. When I felt disconnected I reached out to friends. I started SCHEDULING in showers. Manicures became a priority. I got a new Life Coach. I stopped doing things I didn't wanted to do and started TALKING about and EMBRACING the new me. 

I want to help you find you.

Together, you + I will work one-on-one (at a pace that’s perfect for you) to uncover who you really are and what you really want and create a solid foundation for your life.

Build long-term conversation and community around your brand.
Elevate the conversation around your business, brand, or gathering.
And deeply engage your constituents.

Reflection, writing prompts, and guided questions combine for a deep and new appreciation and understanding of our shared humanity. 

Host an X Factory in your community or with your tribe, and surround yourself with listening, love, and compassion.

I can lead an X Factory with your group, or give you the framework and tools to host a group on your own. 

Here's what women say about X Factory:

""Life-changing.""

""A balm for my hurt heart.""

""I am encouraged, inspired and connected.”

“Great to have such a connection and reminder of all that is possible.”

“This space could not have been more intimate, more special. I feel connected and awake and encouraged about the future.”

“Such a wonderful connectedness. Loved considering beauty from new perspectives

“I experienced a deep sense of connection and appreciation for everyone present.”

“Great community of like-minded, powerful women. Loved the setting, the speakers, the connectedness.

“An absolute inspiration. You connect hope, dreams, inspiration and art.

""Feeling very connected and received by this community. Just what I needed.""

""We are not alone on our paths when we share our authentic selves.""

""A beautiful experience. Thank you so much for holding space for all these amazing women to connect.""

There are two kinds of energy blocks: Your personal ones and your business' blocks.

Personal energy blocks are formed throughout your life, especially during early childhood, when we pick up countless limiting beliefs from circumstances or the adults around us. 

These beliefs may be related to money, self-worth and physical safety, for example.

Whatever these limiting beliefs are, you and I will work together in uncovering them, safely bringing them to light and essentially erasing them from your energy body. 

Then, there are your business' energy blocks. These may have been created during its formation or at any point in time when your beliefs were not aligned with your business goals. 

With an energy technique, I will help you release those blocks, align your business to your goals and infuse your business with renewed energy. 

The results are truly amazing. 

When you book a session, I will send you a questionnaire and ""homework"" that will help you focus into the issue(s) you'd like to release. This prior work enables us to use our sessions most effectively.

The sessions take place online. You will receive a link to initiate a conference call at our meeting time. Please have a pen, notebook and some water ready.

If you would like to schedule a discovery call, please feel free to contact me. 

Being an entrepreneur is the greatest self development journey. I'd be delighted to assist you in amping up your business' success.

The other is more broad and operates in the vein of helping individuals to feel good in their bodies. This can come in the way of food/diet, exercise/movement, and mindfulness/meditation -- often a combination of elements. 

Wellness is such a vast space and can mean many things for different people. Some people seek guidance in the form of nutrition, others in ways of fitness, and still more, a combination of these pieces. Wellness is about finding balance, calm, moments of peace, and when needed, guidance interpreting how to implement medically prescribed lifestyles and diets.

There is no need to stage it. And isn’t this what we want to remember with our photographs? The original, raw and unscripted version of the people we love?

What are the moments you remember from this year?  Certainly it's not just the way you all looked.  Maybe it's the way you sat together and read as a family, snacks in hand and kids cuddled close.  The way Paige ran everywhere she went and Hannah was always a princess.  How you DJ-ed the dance party and spent most of your weekends on the floor, because that's what you do when your kids are little.  

For me, having images of real moments, holding them in my hands or seeing them on my walls, evokes happy memories and fills me with gratitude for the blessings in my life.  They also get my kids asking questions and all of us telling stories about when so-and-so was 2, or that time we went camping in the backyard.  Photographs can be powerful tools for building family connection and roots. 

For a documentary family session, we spend time taking photographs of your family that are mostly unposed and unscripted. We will meet and discuss ways to capture those memories you want to hold on to and those activities that have meaning to you before the photo day ever happens. But the truth is, your family is interesting and fantastic without any planning. The mundane, unique and authentic parts of your life really just happen if you give it time to unfold in front of the camera.  

Family sessions last anywhere from 2 hours to a full day or more. All sessions come with printed artwork and 5x7 gift prints. They also include in-person consultations, planning meetings, and a helpful Session Preparation Guide.  I am more than happy to customize packages to suit your needs.  Let's talk!",photo & video

I have successfully helped young adult girls and women on the South Shore and Cape Cod in all areas of their wardrobe and styling, from petite to plus size.

Finding outfits that are just right for your body type and lifestyle shouldn’t be challenging. But for many women and young adults it is. My passion is to help women find their own sense of style while looking their best with confidence shining through.

The process starts with me learning more about your lifestyle and your fashion needs. From there we schedule a time and place to shop, with me arriving 1.5 hours before to personally hand pick clothing pieces and accessories. We spend the next two hours in a private, personalized setting enjoying trying out outfits hand picked just for your body type. You will learn how to mix and match and add accessories. 

My personal styling services can help you find the perfect fitting jean, make active wear look like an outfit or how to make a casual career outfit dressy enough for a night out. I help women of all age groups – whether it’s a whole new wardrobe or even just find a few more pieces to add to your closet. I will have you looking fashionable and feeling great!

Who uses cash anymore? In today's cashless economy we use credit cards, built in apps or phone wallets to pay. So how do you explain when your child asks where does money come from? Mom and Dad why do you go to work? Why can't you get all the money you want from ATMs?  If any of this sounds familiar, this class is the stop for you. Come along for the ride as we journey through time when corn was good to get what you wanted (or was it?) and IOUs were in fashion. 

In this 5 part series, we will kick off with a story of barter combined with exciting game of Barter Bingo. We will talk about the birth of money, how do banks make money, loan/debt and a challenging 'Simple' and 'Compounded' fun game of interest rate, how transactions work when cash is not exchanged, or in case of Bitcoin when banks are not involved either.

If you have a curious middle schooler who is just learning about the value of currency or a high schooler who is starting to earn something from odd jobs, this is the course for them. 

Students will play finance based games, and participate in various hands-on exercises to experiment with their new found skills in the world of money.  Along the way we will learn about the role of banks, interest rates, credit cards, Blockchain technologies, and the importance of saving, managing, and making good choices in our own future financial lives.

The struggle to get the right services provided for my daughter has not been fun and I know there are other parents feeling the same way I do.

Reiki is Gentle and Restorative. It Complements any medical treatment you are already receiving and can also be used to reduce stress, promote wellness and induce relaxation.

Reiki is used in hospitals and rehabilitation facilities to relieve pain, reduce nausea, bring deep relaxation to patients and enable them to feel a sense of well being. It is used to comfort hospice patients by providing pain relief and reduce stress and anxiety.

​The concept of subtle energy healing has been used in the Chinese, Japanese, Hindu and Christian cultures for thousands of years. These cultures call subtle or nonphysical energies Chi, Qi, Prana or Holy Spirit/Spirit and are believed to inhabit all conscious beings. Here in the west this energy has become known as the Biofield Science.

Biofield Science studies the communication through fields of energy between molecules, cells, and organs that help the body regulate good health.

Reiki is the Japanese term for these subtle energies and the use of these subtle energies to heal the self or another of physical and mental disorders.

Research shows that spiritual experiences positively affect physical health and well-being.
