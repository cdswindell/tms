After much of my own trial and error, I was eventually able to find the right tools to help, that finally led me to shift toward a place of feeling well, having energy and being in good health.

I am grateful to be able to offer you the same tools and modalities that helped me find my own personal wellness and vitality.

My approach involves using different modalities to assist in bringing balance into the body so that it can begin to heal itself.  These modalities involve working with the body’s energetic system to assist in clearing out what may be clogging and weighing down the physical body. As a result, the body has an opportunity to heal and return to its healthy vibrant state.

I’ve got to tell you that’s my favorite thing about what I do, capturing and preserving those moments so you can return to them as many times as you want to in the future and never forget it. Time moves at a rapid pace and our children grow like weeds before our eyes. As a mother I’ve never regretted not capturing those times and so thankful I did, because I’m constantly reminiscing and in awe of how fast my son has grown up.
My style is timeless, organic, simplistic and fun. I make sure you have fun at in your session with me. Photos shouldn't be work, they should be a fun experience where you leave with a smile on your face, not ""phew it’s over."" 

I’ve been photographing children for the last 25 years and have several methods of capturing their personalities. I love when they run around and play. I want to capture those moments, that’s who they are. I always recommend parents getting in a few because your children will love seeing pictures of the whole family not just them. They love you just the way you are.",,"""I've never once heard anyone ever say they regretted having their moments captured."""

Every time I would climb into bed, I wondered what was going to be the story of that night. Will it be about a mischievous raccoon, a clever fox or mice singing and dancing? Thanks to her, I became an avid reader. Nothing gives me more pleasure than reading good literature and especially good children’s literature. 

After working for a publisher for 20 years writing and developing English language materials for children and support materials for parents, I decided to go back to the world my grandmother opened up to me when I was a little girl—the world of folktales.  

I now create kamishibai (paper theater) stories for children based on folktales from around the world. Kamishibai is a traditional Japanese form of storytelling that combines large illustrated cards with narration. The cards are usually presented inside a wooden stage. Using my own kamishibai, I tell stories to children in day-care centers, schools, libraries, and other places and events that would welcome a kamishibai presentation, for instance, birthday parties. It gives me tremendous joy to see the children’s eyes shine in anticipation when I’m opening the little doors of the wooden stage at the start of storytelling. 

In addition to storytelling, I also teach Japanese language privately. I am a native speaker of Japanese, fluent in Portuguese and English, with a MA in linguistics and child language acquisition. I welcome students of all ages and walks of life. With children, I do storytelling, role-playing, and lots of hands-on activities to keep the lessons fun and engaging. With adults, I tailor the content to the students’ interests (Japanese cuisine, art, literature, etc) and needs (travel, business, etc).",,"I am a writer, illustrator and storyteller of kamishibai (Japanese paper theater) and a Japanese language tutor"

behavior management for children. Using a strengths-based perspective, I help

On paper, I am a licensed independent clinical social worker (LICSW) with a
Master’s degree in Social Work from Boston College; in practice, I have applied
training experience in a wide range of settings including acute residential
treatment centers, hospitals, schools, and correctional facilities.

For over 10 years, I have guided pediatricians in the care of children and
adolescents with emotional and behavioral issues through the Massachusetts
Child Psychiatry Access Project at Tufts Medical Center. During my tenure there,
I was introduced to ""Incredible Years"" and ""Triple P""—two key evidence-based
curricula that form the basis for my consulting practice. Throughout my career, I
have had the privilege of working with people in diverse contexts and have
served a wide variety of populations, which makes me confident that I can help
families find the appropriate techniques and approaches for their individual
needs. On a personal level, I am now challenged to “practice what I preach,” in the
evolution of my relationships with my own two young boys.",,"As a child social worker for over 15 years, I have seen all sorts of behavior.  In a residential care setting I was managing this behavior myself, so I've been in the trenches.  As a therapist my role has shifted to helping kids learn to manage their emotions and helping caregivers manage the behaviors.   

I am trained in ""Incredible Years"" and ""Triple P"" which are two evidence-based models for parent training.  There are a million books out there on the ""right way"" to parent and many of them contradict each other; therefore when I started private consultations my goal became to help families identify the right tools for them.  Simply put, the tools won't work if they don't fit your style or your child's temperament."

The idea for RosePost Box was born in 2017, when I combined an interest I’ve had all my life – rose beauty - with my passion for green beauty and creating unique gifts. 

Growing up in Bulgaria – a small country often referred to as ‘the Land of Roses’ for its centuries-old tradition in producing the best rose essential oil in the world – pure rosewater was a natural remedy for my sensitive skin. My focus on safer ingredients in skincare became even more of a priority since becoming a parent.

RosePost Box is a curated seasonal box, featuring the best in clean, rose-infused beauty from artisan brands from Europe and North America. I'm passionate about giving authentic rose beauty center stage and sharing the benefits and luxury of rose oil with others.

In addition to the subscription option for customers who want to get that surprise self-care package each season, we create one-time gift and special edition boxes, curated around a holiday or special occasion (bridal, Mother’s Day, etc.). 

Please, check out our website to see if you can find or if I can help you create that special occasion (or special person) rose-infused gift.

Just move it around, it's ok.  As a young girl I used to lock my bedroom door and move all my furniture around by myself and not let my parents enter the room until I was done.  It made me feel better about my very small room that I had to share with my two older siblings in our very modest home, I waited until they moved out to make it my own.  Prior to that I used to go up into our unfinished attic and create a living room of my own with old furniture and rugs that had been put up in storage.  I would listen to my 45's on my record player and make believe I was in my own home.  Such fun!

Over the years I took courses in the Fashion Design field from pattern drafting to figure drawing which I enjoyed thoroughly but it was a difficult industry and eventually found employment as a marketing and legal secretary as I had to pay the bills. When my husband and I moved to the area we got engaged, built a house and were married all in one year.  This was when I decided I could decorate my own home and I was certain I could make all my window treatments as I had sewn some of my own clothing when I was a young girl and on into adulthood. 

And so, Lisa Smith Interiors was born in 1997 and I was open for business specializing in window treatments and having fun designing and creating custom draperies and bedding.  I fabricated all the projects I designed and soon was offering blinds and shades from manufacturers I partnered with, sourcing carpet and tile distributors, lamps etc.  I was very active in every aspect of my business and did my own installations which I loved to do as well.  I learned everything I know about being a handy woman from my dad, what fun I had with him with all our projects around the house.

Fast forward, I did many projects for friends and neighbors in my area and soon grew my little business into something a little bigger but not too big so I could still raise my two children.  It was the perfect set up, I had my workroom in my basement and could go to work whenever I felt like it and when I needed to go to an appointment with a client my friends I had made in playgroup with my kids would watch my son and daughter.  It was hectic but I was enjoying being back to work after starting my family. I had many clients and always loved the look on their faces when they saw my creations installed for the first time, wow that was my favorite part.

A year and a half ago we finally started the project we had been talking about for 20 years, finishing the basement, yes the very basement where my workroom was set up.  At this point I had to take a break from my business as I knew it, dismantle what I had created and put it all on hold so to speak, which was very difficult. I continued working with existing clients while seeking the help of an outside workroom to fill my orders but my attention had to be on finishing our basement as I was now a General Contractor (self appointed) and boy did I enjoy that!  Working with all the tradesmen and seeking out all the materials needed from start to finish was an incredible experience that I knew I would enjoy and would welcome doing again. The basement now has a dual purpose, partial workroom and music / entertainment area for my kids.  It was time to rethink where my business was going!

I have been taking care of my kids for over 16 years now and with my son being on the spectrum I had made the decision when he was 2 to free our house of harmful chemicals and head down a path of better health and wellness for my whole family. It has been a long road with caring for my son and his needs but he has come a long way and I have learned so much from all the talented practitioners that worked with him and still do.  We have met many doctors over the years and presently consult with a dedicated Functional Medicine doctor and nutritionist who have helped our whole family immensely, so much so that I have shifted my interest to whole health, holistic health / holistic interiors. 

I have a fond memory of a project that I worked on where a friend came to me with a special piece of fabric that she or her grandmother had purchased and nothing had been done with it.  Her grandmother unfortunately was receiving hospice services at home and my friend wanted to surprise her with a pretty window treatment to make her feel better.  I was thrilled and honored to be asked to create such a special treatment and her grandmother loved it and it made her feel better in her space.  This project is one that I have not forgotten and have thought about it many times over the years.

And so, the rebirth of my interiors business: Holistic Interiors, Healthy From The Outside In.",,"I love color"". I am always amazed at how it makes you feel!

I had even started making my own yogurt, bread and granola from scratch. I was pretty proud of myself and thought that surely I had the whole family on the right track with our health. But then I slowly began to realize that I was tired all the time. My son was no longer a baby so I couldn’t blame it on constant sleepless nights anymore (although there were still some of those). I chalked it up to being a mom and getting older (I had just passed another decade mark after all – yikes!) and thought it was “normal.”

Then, one day, as I was scrolling through my Facebook feed a post from one of the real food, natural mom bloggers I follow caught my eye. It was about Adrenal Fatigue. I had never heard of this before but the more I read and researched the more I began to realize that the fatigue I was experiencing may be common in women like me, but that did not mean it was normal. I finally felt like I could do something about my fatigue (other than drinking more coffee) and I decided I didn’t want to continue living in a constant state of tiredness. 

Since then I’ve learned to focus on choosing the best foods for me and my body. And while I focus on healthy food a lot, I try not to stress about it. I’ve become more aware of how food affects me and more mindful of how and why I’m eating. I make choices based on this awareness. And sometimes I still choose one of the muffins I made for the kids instead of making an energizing smoothie! But I don’t judge, I learn from it. I’ve also learned that being mindful of stress in my life is key to feeling energized. No one can eliminate every stressor in their life but I go to yoga, take hikes with my family, slow down to enjoy the park with my kids and bask in the sunshine whenever possible. These are simple changes that you, too, can make to be your best self!",,I believe that every mom deserves to feel their best and have the energy to enjoy time with their family.

Spoiler alert, it does get better and it was an integral part of my happiness now.


Here it is, suckiness and all;

​

From an early age, I felt like there was something wrong with me, I never quite fit in and I wondered why I had this underlying sense that life was difficult and I wasn't good enough to make it better . I asked myself questions like, “Why can't I seem to do things right?"", ""What's wrong with me?"" and ""Why is life so hard?"". During many periods of my life, I dealt with feelings of abandonment, I would isolate myself from others because of hurt I didn't know how to deal with and I continually felt awkward while constantly second guessing my choices. Because I was unfulfilled and struggling, I began to look for external ways to compensate for what was missing in my life. This led me to even more hardships and challenges and from there I began to spiral into a darker and deeper place. From the outside, I became a master at disguise, most people didn't know of my suffering.


I lived like this until a major crisis nudged (okay actually pushed me hard, real hard) to finally look in the mirror and ask why.


Why was my life in such disarray and falling apart?

What happened to get me here?

How could I turn things around?

Who did I want to be?

And what did I want for myself?


This helped me to start, step by excruciatingly small step, to work on the things I wanted to improve in my life. Believe me it was a slow process and I stumbled through it until finally I began to trust and feel good about myself and in return started to accept all of my ME-NESS including my perceived flaws and mistakes.

​

This was key!

​

Realizing the importance of striving and setting goals while believing that it was possible to have a better life, coupled with the acceptance and love for even the ugly, undisciplined parts of myself had finally turned my whole world around! 

​

Because of all the major work I needed to do on myself, I learned some pretty cool tricks and techniques that I'd like to call magic (and this magic came through years of trainings, education, studies and the perfect smattering of my unique gifts which are inherently tied to this work) I couldn't have made it this far without them. So here I am, now, sharing what I've learned, facilitating a sacred, safe space for your YOU-NESS to shine through and having loads of fun doing it. I LOVE my work and I would like to share it with you. I want to share my magic with you.

As I watched my professor sipping coffee and talking about books, I thought, ""I want to do this -- read, talk, and write about great writing -- forever."" I went to graduate school, wrote a dissertation on sympathy in the 19th-century British novel, and got a Ph.D. in English literature. I taught composition and literature courses at Tufts University and at Providence College, and I worked on my own writing, publishing two scholarly articles. I also worked briefly as a college admissions reader, reading and evaluating admissions applications for a small, private, liberal arts college in Massachusetts. Teaching classes and working in admissions, I realized how far-reaching my interest in ""great writing"" is. I like to read and write about literature; but I love to help others improve and polish their own writing.

I fantasized about walking the entire island and understanding every word I heard in every language throughout the walk. I thought of Spring and Fall as lulls between Summer and Winter; I didn't really experience them as seasons except during the occasional stroll in Central Park. The daughter of two writers and editors, I began editing while still in my teens. My love of language has persisted since childhood, and I'm still trying to recover from the nature deprivation; wildcrafting my own herbal remedies and hunting for mushrooms are some of the best ways to do this!! 

Health struggles led me onto a path of holistic healing that includes herbalism, shiatsu, qigong, and nutrition.

Having a child changed my life completely. I never anticipated homeschooling or becoming a stay-at-home mom, but I fell in love with my little one and have never looked back. Now she's a teen and we're still at it, although at this stage that includes community college. As a homeschooling parent, I do a lot of teaching and coaching. I teach classes and workshops in our community, and I coach my kid through her journey of self-directed learning.",,"I'm a homeschooling mom and I'm passionate about language and health. I practice many professions, most of them related to those two passions. Empowerment and respect are two core principles for me. I want to give you the tools you need to take charge of your own health sustainably, to express exactly what you mean, to learn languages in a way that will work for you, and show profound respect for the language and culture you're studying, and more. I also love the plant world and connecting people with it; that's why I teach herbalism and foraging, as well as why I garden and love wandering in the woods.

It may not be the best we are capable and maybe we’ll do “better” in the future. But self-acceptance rather than ruminating on what is wrong with us can go a long way in the healing process.

I love my work for many reasons, but I feel especially blessed to be able to help families through a confusing and overwhelming period.

The questions may be unique, but the stress and confusion surrounding planning and preparing for college is almost universal. Moms need to know: ""is he even ready?"" ""Will she find friends there?"" ""What are we really paying for?"" ""Can he get a job with that degree?"" and, ""What happens when she changes her mind again?"" I don't have a crystal ball, of course, but I can reassure you that you are not the first parent to worry about these things. I can point you toward the answers and resources your family needs to get (or keep) your child on the right track.

Sometimes moms and dads forget that kids have just as many questions as they do...even when they don't have much to say about college. My special skill is quickly building trust and rapport with not just parents, but teenagers as well. My key to success in working with teens is getting them to trust me...because that makes it easy for them to like me...and eventually not just take my advice, but actively seek it out. Nothing pleases me more than getting a thoughtful, complex question from a teenager in need, because it validates my effort to be their personal trusted resource.

I offer tailored services for parents and for students, including how to research colleges, essay strategy and critique, test planning, and application process management and support. You and your child need a resource who makes you feel comfortable, but also has the expertise this complex process requires. I am pleased to offer you my support.",,I love helping moms (& dads!) to feel more at ease when it comes to their children's college plans.

I have been studying this vast  subject with more rigor and passion now that both my children have grown and I have a little more time on my hands. 

I use Astrology as a tool for self awareness and discovery in my life. For instance, I have come to accept and to work around the knowledge that it's difficult for me to complete some of my projects because I have an inner critic that has to have things perfect and is always editing and getting in the way (Venus in Virgo).

I remember when I suddenly understood that my double Scorpio husband, SUN and MOON exact degree, with 5 planets in the 6th house of Virgo, wasn't just working all the time to ignore me, but he NEEDED to work and be of use. It was what he came here to do. I understood that this was not easy for my Leo Sun who needed a lot of attention and how my Moon and Rising sign in Gemini NEEDED to talk. 

Understanding the Zodiac and how people close to me are expressions of it has brought, and continues to bring a whole new level of compassion, wisdom and understanding to my relationships. Unfortunately, so much of what we hear in the world today about the Zodiac is a watered down version of Astrology. It's lost its roots in the rich traditions of its sacred origins. 

I am very grateful to have found some amazing teachers affiliated with credible Astrological organizations who are dedicated to creating standards around this blossoming field. My hope is to continue my studies through a deep connection to the Natural world and to share this wonderful subject with others to help us live more fulfilled and balanced lives.",,"My business grew out of a passion I have for creating art, and my deep love of Astrology.

Like many young girls, in my teens I was self-conscious and overly critical of my body and how I looked.  I would waver between periods of restrictive dieting and skipping meals and losing control and binging on junk food.  With each ""failure"" I would become more and more depressed.  Things got worse when I went to college and had freedom for the first time.  For the first semester or so I partied a lot on the weekends and ate poorly. When first semester report cards were handed out I looked at mine, satisfied at my 3.0 average. Then I heard two girls in the row behind me compare report cards with each other; they both had 4.0s. I realized - wow I got a 3.0 but I was giving nowhere near 100% effort. Imagine if I had given it my all what I could have achieved! That moment lit a fire under me and I did a complete 180 in all areas of my life. I cut out processed food and alcohol and started hitting the gym 1-2 hours a day. I walked everywhere. I would study in the library until 2am most nights and on weekends I started going home and waitressed in addition to my work-study job.  I felt a sense of pride for pushing myself so hard but then I started hearing from people I knew who hadn't seen me in a while that I was too skinny. At the time I took that as a compliment but I knew I was heading for trouble. My efforts to living a healthy lifestyle weren't healthy at all.  I had some fainting spells and developed pneumonia. My body was trying to tell me something and I needed to listen. I was scared straight for a little while, but still didn't know how to stop myself from beating myself up for not being perfect.

After graduating and working in corporate for a while I realized I needed to find a healthy way to incorporate working out and eating right into my life. It was a struggle to find the right balance. Everyone seemed to want to go to bars on the weekend and I was not the least bit interested. I also still had a lot of fears about food - and avoided a lot of social events for fear I would blow my diet.  I had to find a better way. In my twenties, I idolized the female figure athletes in the fitness magazines and wanted to look like they did - lean, strong and fit but I never thought I was worthy enough to train for and compete in a show. I thought I would be ridiculed, that no one would get it, that I would never get my body that fit or look like I belonged on stage let alone win a trophy. 
 
When I found out about a local fitness camp I signed up to go, thinking I would just be a spectator and take it all in. The coaches and team were so supportive and encouraging and told me I needed to do the next Fitness America Pageant show that was only 9 weeks away!  I began training and tightened up my nutrition plan. The team met weekly to workout and pose together. What was really awesome is that although these women were all ages...from 20s to 50s, all different walks of life, from all over, we were joined together by our shared purpose and common goal. We bonded as we each went through struggles and self-doubts and found our inner strength. We shared in each others successes along the way. I got in the best shape of my life but the best part is the way I changed on the inside.  The self-confidence I gained spilled over to and impacted every other area of my life. It was a life-changing experience.

Today, I am in my 40s and after having two babies, working full-time and trying to accomplish so many things I realized I needed to make an adjustment on my wellness journey once again.

I see so many busy, smart women give up on themselves because they are living in constant overwhelm and don't know how to take care of themselves. I developed my coaching program to show women that they can get amazing results without spending all day in the kitchen or the gym just by having a simple plan and following it consistently. My mission is to help women identify and overcome their inner roadblocks so they can transform their bodies and their lives. I promote a holistic approach to health - one that involves creating daily habits and incorporates a healthy dose of self-care (so overlooked but so important)!

My passion is helping busy women who struggle with yo-yo dieting and weight gain develop strategies to break this cycle and find a way of eating that intuitively fits their personality and lifestyle. 
I know what this struggle feels like because I fought this battle for many years. I would try diet after diet, only to end up back at square one, feeling sluggish with aching joints and worst of all, heavier. Being an ICU nurse I saw first hand what a lifetime of bad habits could bring. Knowing that obesity is a precursor to some major chronic diseases, I knew I had to make a change for my health and longevity. 
Toward the end of November 2016 I enrolled in the Institute for Integrative Nutrition’s health coach training program to learn about how to approach weight loss and wellness from a holistic perspective. One month later, the real motivation I needed to kick myself into gear came when I weighed in at 257lbs at my doctor’s office 4 days before Christmas. Something had to change. I’d done this so many times before, it literally felt like now or never. Not being sure what to do first, I know I needed to first be compassionate toward myself which was new for me. I didn’t immediately plan to indulge in something decadent that would make me “feel better”. Instead I focused on finding a way to approach weight loss that fit my personality and my life. What worked in the past wouldn’t work this time. What I know for sure is, there is no “one size fits all” prescription for losing weight and getting healthier. I devised a plan unique to me which resulted in me being 10 lbs lighter at my next check in with my doctor six weeks later. 
Using a bio-individual approach, I spent 2017 transforming my own health, successfully shedding 93+lbs through practicing intuitive eating, mindfulness, and focusing on self care. I’m passionate about helping others discover their own unique way to release weight, and break the diet-weight gain-diet cycle so that they can feel in control of their bodies, and more confident in the chaos of life.",,Releasing weight and eating healthy doesn't have to be complicated.

I'm also a private math tutor because nothing is better than working with a student one-on-one to help them realize their full potential in mathematics. 

Some quick tidbits from my CV:
-B.A. in Economics with a focus on mathematics and environmental studies
-Graduate work in mathematics, specifically Number Theory
-Current Program Supervisor for Mathematics for the Teacher Education Program at The College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, MA
-Former High School Math Teacher for the Natick Public Schools
-Massachusetts Licenced Math Teacher grades 5-12
-Math Content Creator for YouTube
-Private Tutor for 8 years (4 years part-time, 4 years full-time)

When my daughter was born, I asked for a 1-year sabbatical so I could figure out what was best for my family. I began to tutor full-time and create math content for YouTube. This lead to a realization that I was able to continue what I had been born to do (helping students understand mathematics) while still being able to spend time with my daughter. I had made up my mind--I couldn't go back. 

Fast-forward to today. I've been tutoring full-time for 4 years and still create online content for YouTube. In 2017, I became the Program Supervisor for Mathematics for the Teacher Education Program at The College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, MA. In this role, I get the opportunity to help train the next generation of middle and high school mathematics teachers. 

In 2019, I will launch Ms. Milkosky Preschool, an online mathematics resource for parents and educators that will help them bring the beauty of mathematics to everyday play.

What I do:

A majority of my work is with couples (engagement, adventure sessions, elopements & weddings) and families looking to capture special moments in life, and to stand time still for even just a moment. I also enjoy working with individuals for sessions that highlight their brands and professionalism whether it's for their corporate job or their own business. And one of my favorite type of sessions include photographing women in their element, and making sure they feel beautiful, alive and empowered. 

My approach:

Although I do studio work and enjoy that variation from time to time, my muse really is nature and adventure. I use the elements of nature and natural light to pull together a story that can be remembered and bring smiles to others faces every time they see the photo.

It's a sincere joy and fills my heart to be able to give clients photos that they can cherish for years to come.","",“We take photos as a return ticket to a moment otherwise gone.”

I help people create great relationships at home, at work, and in the community. I also help folks navigate specific relationship challenges in ways that feel good to them. 

This can be done through 1:1 conversations as well as group workshops, presentations and events.

WHEN & WHY YOU MIGHT NEED IT
Working with me is useful when you have a desire to improve a relationship, or to feel more connected to people in general, but either don't know how or are feeling scared or conflicted about it. You might be thinking:

""I want to reconcile, but I don't know how.""
""I want to reach out, but I don't know what to say.""
""I want to forgive, but I still feel so hurt.""
""I want to express more of who I am, but I don't know if they want to hear it.""
""I want to be a better listener, but I'm afraid of what I might hear.""

You might also be a leader who knows that strong relationships are critical to organizational success, and are looking for effective ways to:
- build trust & goodwill
- reduce emotional drama
- improve communication
- inspire creativity and engagement

I can help with that, too.

WHAT MAKES ME GOOD AT THIS
First and foremost, because I love it! I think and write about this stuff all the time. My weekly blog revolves around themes of happiness, connection, and navigating the daily ups and downs of life and relationships. You can read it here: www.thegiftofhappiness.org/blog

Over the past several years, I've taught courses and workshops in both business and community settings on happiness, emotions, listening, self-accountability, giving & receiving, and more. I especially like helping people re-frame situations from a fresh perspective, and identify small, practical changes that will actually feel good and make a difference for them.

My formal education includes a Bachelor's degree in psychology and religious studies from Brown University and a Master’s in Clinical Social Work from Boston College. I also worked for over a decade in Human Resources at MIT, and spent a significant amount of time as a hospice volunteer.

I look forward to working with you!",,"I'm all about helping people create happiness in their lives, by doing what they love and sharing the best of themselves with others.
