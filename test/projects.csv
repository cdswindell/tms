This made it essential to have another person I could show Lisa interacting with.

For the head shots, I attempted to capture Lisa's upbeat, positive personality by adding some splashes of color in the background."

My partner, Jean Birnberg, and I were thrilled to work with the Pepperlane staff to create a warm and festive atmosphere for their very first Holiday Celebration. The budget was tight a that was a gift! That's when we get to be really creative. The room was as rectangle as they come with very high ceilings. Cafe tables were scattered about and topped with custom-made centerpieces featuring violet P's to reinforce the Pepperlane logo design. Deep and tall window sills were filled with natural twigs in vases and handmade (by us) twine balls painted in Pepperlane colors. We had so much fun learning to make the balls which really make a big impact without a lot of money. We wrapped individual spruce saplings with natural parchment and twine for guests to take home to grow with their businesses."

She has two teenagers and knew she needed to go through and purge a lot of their childhood stuff that was no longer needed in addition to a lot of her own stuff.  Her in laws were coming to visit in a few months and she told me that her wish was that her ""kitchen counter would be clear enough to have a vase of flowers and display when they arrive.""  

Every time she tried to get rid of stuff, she seemed to hit a road block. She would sort and  select things for donation, but a month later the pile would still be there instead of having been donated.  Or she'd start working on a bin and a few hours later she was still working on the same bin, just increasingly frustrated.

We began working together on a weekly basis.  We broke her entire house into small parts and manageable projects.  We started with some smaller things like a junk drawer or a linen closet to help raise her confidence.  Then we moved on to bigger projects like the attic, closets and kitchen.  At the end of each session, I took everything she had decided to donate with me, so it was out the door.

We had our last session a few days before her in laws arrived. At the end of the session I presented her with a bouquet of yellow flowers that she could now proudly display on her clutter-free counter."

My customer showed up at my house with seemingly unrelated, mismatched fabric and asked me to make a quilt for her mom.  I quickly learned that her mom was an excellent seamstress.  Through the years, she made curtains, pillowcases, prom dresses and most importantly my customer's wedding dress.  Her mom would also by fabric that reminded her of her daughter with the intention of one day doing something with it.  My customer could not part with the fabric so I made a modern patchwork quilt that has the wedding dress fabric woven throughout the quilt.  The only fabric purchased was the border and backing fabric."

The financial industry has taught me how little adequate financial education there is and especially in the US. This is a problem! I love holding educational forums to the public and teaching them the basics or “7 steps” to financial success. 

I have seen the horror that happens to people when they don’t take the time to care for their financial well-being. If I’m holding free educational workshops to educate folks then I feel I am doing my part in sharing my gift with the community. We all win! And have some laughs. 

I love co-presenting with other professionals. I have recently held co-presentations with a college admissions advisor, health & wellness coach, estate attorney, realtor and life coach. 

I have made many new friends this way and love giving back. An attitude of gratitude always wins. If you would like to co-present, have an educational event at your organization or attend one, please don’t hesitate to reach out. I have a variety of interesting, fun and educational topics. "

She Is a single parent working more than full time and supporting the household on her own. 

When I first spoke with her, she had tears in her eyes. Her daughter was getting ready to go off to college and she didn’t know how she was going to afford education funding on top of paying a mortgage, bills and caring for the younger son. We started at ground zero, auditing her budget, cash flow, loans, other debts and insurances. She was working with the college to get financial aid and they would not budge on what they had to offer. They suggested she sign on the dotted lines and take out parent plus loans. These are very high interest rate loans and take many more years to pay off because of the interest. 

I drafted a letter to the financial aid representatives of the school On behalf of the client stating her need for financial aid. Again, they would not budge. 

We then looked into loans with lower interest elsewhere. I made sure the client had the right insurance at a low cost to protect her and the family should anything happen to avoid anymore debts from occurring or even falling into poverty. I was able to ‘free up’ cash flow for her by saving her money on her mortgage and car insurance. She has significantly paid down credit cards, her daughter is in school and excelling and she has received a promotion at work.

We have 6 month check ins to make sure she is staying on the up path and we are tackling any events that life throws at us at any given time. 

The client is grateful for my help and I am grateful to have her has a client and proud of all she has accomplished so far. I’m looking forward to our next check in meeting and helping her reach her goals throughout her life. "

The last time she had professional photos taken was at her wedding.  She has a CD of images from her wedding day, and she always meant to make an album.  But life got busy, and she only got around to printing and framing one picture.  

Dana emailed me inquiring about a family photography session, saying she liked that the pictures on my website seemed to tell a story.  The kids in the pictures were natural, and always in motion, just like her kids. But Dana was hesitant about doing day-in-the-life photography.  She was worried she wouldn’t like the pictures of her own family in that style.  She was worried about her house looking messy and cluttered.  She was worried she had ‘an awkward smile’ and she wouldn’t look good without someone to pose her.  She also thought the kids might not ‘behave’ for that long.

I told her I knew how she felt.  In fact, this is the typical response I get from new clients.  In-home photography reveals some of your most intimate moments in your personal space. It’s no wonder people feel hesitant.  But that intimacy and familiarity is exactly what makes the images so meaningful and poignant to them later on.  And real life includes the ups and downs with kids – I am prepared for this, and actually love photographing it!
 
To assure her we would get something she liked, I told Dana we would take one or two “grandma shots” –a few standard pictures with everyone smiling and looking at the camera.  Then I asked her questions about her family, which is the actually the most important part of our preparation.  Her stories helped me understand what she valued in her family, and helped me seek out some of the special moments she described. 

In the end, we had an amazing session.  Everyone had their activities to focus on (instead of the camera!), and the time went by quickly.  Dana has been overjoyed with the pictures we took.  She was grateful that we preserved some classic expressions from the girls that she always wanted to capture.  Now she has pictures from our session framed in her living room and hallway.  And because Dana is a busy mom, and didn’t want any more guilty feelings over unprinted pictures, I created a beautiful album for her that tells the story of our fall afternoon together.

Mary’s #FiveStar Review: “The level of communication you receive with Maryelle is top-notch, she is professional and put me at ease with the process. She was available for my questions at every step, made sure I was prepared for my trial, promptly followed-up after to find out how my experience was, and even sent me a brief note the weekend before my weekend, just to send her best wishes. She matched me up with the perfect make-up/hair stylist, Kristen. At the time of my hair and make-up trial I had a vague idea of what my vision was. This included a few magazine cutouts and Pinterest posts. I also had a gold floral headpiece that I thought I was going to use on my wedding day and Kristen put together a hairstyle around that. I ended up nixing that hairpiece before the wedding day, used a flower comb instead, and Kristen totally went with it, and I ended up with the PERFECT wedding day style (for me). I was in love with it. My nugget of advice to brides is make sure you look at photos of brides with similar hair length and texture. Kristen is a rockstar and if anyone I know ever needs make-up/hair services, I would jump into the conversation to recommend Kristen (and Maryelle Aristry overall). If you are a bride looking for hair and wedding services, you want Maryelle Aristry as part of your wedding day team.” #weddingwire @weddingwire #weddings #bride #bridalhair #bridalmakeup #weddinghair #weddingmakeup #bostonhairstylist #bostonmakeupartist @boston_wedding_group"

I gave her my quote and since it was going to work fine with my schedule I said could do it!

After picking up the chocolate at TJ's I drove over to the friend's house (where she works), she wasn't there. After contacting my client, she finds out friend is wont be home for another 20-30 minutes, so can I write a note with the chocolate and leave it by the door? I know this is still a surprise for the friend so I tried to come up with some way to package this nicely with what I had! My client gives me something cute to write, I package it as nicely as I can in the brown paper bag I have, and found a few flowers on the side of the road to make it all the more special and leave it by her door.


This was such a sweet thing for my friend to want to do and wanted to make it even more special. Making people happy is a great side effect of my business!
