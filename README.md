Table Management System

The Table Management System is a Java implementation of a type-free table system adapted from the BBN Prophet system developed under NIH grant in the 1970’s and 1980’s. It featured spreadsheets with derived columns decades before Microsoft Excel took over the desk top market. 

Over my career in software development, the Prophet Tables concept has been a useful data model to both store and manipulate data. In the 1990’s, I adapted the software to support a molecular spreadsheet used in the Molecular Simulations Cerius 2 software.
