Table Management System

TMS, the Table Management System, is a Java subsystem to efficiently manage and analyze tabular data. Its special ability is that it allows users to defined derived columns, derived rows, and derived cells, to perform ad-hoc data analyses. TMS provides a rich language of over 250 functions (see below), as well as allows developers to develop their own functions to operate on standard or custom datatypes from within the framework. TMS allows Java developers to easily incorporate spreadsheet-like analytics capability into web and applet applications.

The TMS data structures are performant, and the project uses test-driven development to provide quality and code coverage. A rich API is provided that allows developers to easily and quickly integrate TMS into their applications. Full Javadoc and source are provided.

See the TMS Wiki at https://github.com/cdswindell/tms/wiki for complete details and to learn how to become involved.

See the TMS API Javadoc at for details on using the TMS API.
